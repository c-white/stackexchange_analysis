Stackexchange Analysis

Author: Christopher J. White
Date: February 2015

This is a program for analyzing one's Stackexchange answers, in particular the
"quality" and the voted score.

Run the program analyze.py from this directory. See that file for instructions,
or run as
    ./analyze.py -h
If the Python interpreter is not /usr/bin/python, call Python explicitly:
    python analyze.py -h

Before the program can produce meaningful output, one must gather data from
    http://data.stackexchange.com/physics/query/273688/scores-for-my-answers
(or use data/example_answer_data.csv for the author's personal answer history).
One must also assign integer quality scores (recommended from 0 to 5 inclusive)
to all answers manually, following the format of data/example_quality_data.dat.

Data files (e.g. .csv, .dat) can be placed in the data/ directory. Plots (e.g.
.png) can be placed in the plots/ directory.
